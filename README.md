This repository contains the tools to treat cloud workload data and to create and test models.
In particular, the `data_extraction` folder contains the scripts to pre-process the input data. So far, we refer to the [Google cluster data (2011)](https://research.google/tools/datasets/cluster-workload-traces/) as our first primary source.

The `high-level monitoring` folder includes the means for generating and testing models. Specifically, we have so far the code to develop LSTM and transformer neural networks.
